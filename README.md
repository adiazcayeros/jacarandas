# jacarandas
Geocoded files of jacarandas and trees in historic center of Mexico City. 

Superimposed to the 1753 map of Villasenor y Sanchez. The geocoding was done by hand by Alberto Diaz-Cayeros, using ESRIs basemap updated March 15, 2018 (Spring). Tree cover is approximate since it is not always easy to identify individual trees in dense canopy.

Geocoding of Jacaranda trees in Center of Mexico City, as visible from ESRI ArcGIS World Imagery, updated in March 15, 2018. The images allow the location of Jacarandas through visible canopy (1m resolution, Spring of 2018). Identification of trees was visually confirmed through visual inspection around the streets of downtown Mexico City at the Alameda, the Zocalo and Santa Catarina square.

Approximate geocoding of trees in Center of Mexico City, as visible from ESRI ArcGIS World Imagery, updated in March 15, 2018. The images allow the location of visible canopy (1m resolution, Spring of 2018). There are likely errors of undercounting due to dense canopy in parks where identification of individual trees is difficult, and some uncertainty in blocks where imagery has shadows. Trees are included regardless of size, including very small trees on sidewalks. Palm trees are identified less precisely, due to sparse canopy cover.
